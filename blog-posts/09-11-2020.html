        The first several weeks of the course focused on introducing basic HTML
        and CSS.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the <a href="https://twodee.org/blog/17563">first lecture</a> and
        <a href="https://twodee.org/blog/17571">Lab 1</a>, we learned web
        development terminology
        and produced basic web pages using HTML. In particular, my group's task
        for the first lab was to list ingredients for a cookie recipe, utilizing
        both ordered and unordered lists:
      </p>
      <pre>
&#x3C;!DOCTYPE html&#x3E;
&#x3C;html&#x3E;
&#x3C;body&#x3E;
  &#x3C;h1&#x3E;Kringla&#x3C;/h1&#x3E;
  &#x3C;h2&#x3E;Ingredients&#x3C;/h2&#x3E;
  &#x3C;ul&#x3E;
    &#x3C;li&#x3E;1 1/2 cups white sugar&#x3C;/li&#x3E;
    &#x3C;li&#x3E;1 egg&#x3C;/li&#x3E;
    &#x3C;li&#x3E;2 1/2 cups sour cream&#x3C;/li&#x3E;
    &#x3C;li&#x3E;4 cups all-purpose flour&#x3C;/li&#x3E;
    &#x3C;li&#x3E;2 teaspoons baking soda&#x3C;/li&#x3E;
    &#x3C;li&#x3E;1/4 teaspoon salt&#x3C;/li&#x3E;
  &#x3C;/ul&#x3E;
  &#x3C;h2&#x3E;Directions&#x3C;/h2&#x3E;
  &#x3C;ol&#x3E;
    &#x3C;li&#x3E;Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease or line baking sheets with parchment paper.&#x3C;/li&#x3E;
    &#x3C;li&#x3E;Combine the sugar, beaten egg and sour cream together. Mix in the flour, baking soda and salt. Blend thoroughly.&#x3C;/li&#x3E;
    &#x3C;li&#x3E; Divide dough in half and form each half into a long roll. (Note: If your kitchen is warm, keep the half of
    dough you&#x27;re not working with in the refrigerator.)&#x3C;/li&#x3E;
    &#x3C;li&#x3E;Cut off a narrow slice of dough. Roll lightly with hands on lightly floured board into pencil-like strip about 7
    inches long. Form into a figure &#x22;8&#x22;, and pinch ends together. Place on cookie sheet. Repeat with remaining dough.&#x3C;/li&#x3E;
    &#x3C;li&#x3E;Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 12 to 15 minutes.&#x3C;/li&#x3E;
  &#x3C;/ol&#x3E;
&#x3C;/body&#x3E;
&#x3C;/html&#x3E;

        Then during the <a href="https://twodee.org/blog/17577">second lecture</a>,
        we were introduced
        to ways to improve accessibility in our code and why accessibility
        matters. I was personally fascinated
        by the <a href="https://youtu.be/7Rs3YpsnfoI">video from TheDOITCenter</a>
        on screen reader software and the difference that developers can make on
        people's experience using software and websites. On a personal level,
        even if I fail to design visually pleasing websites after completing the
        course,
        I hope that I will develop usable and accessible software and websites.
      </p>
      <p>
        Accessibility was also a recurring theme in
        the <a href="https://twodee.org/blog/17586">third lecture</a>, which
        focused on style but reiterated the necessary of making
        appropriate style choices to assert readability and avoid interfering
        with browser accessibility tools.
